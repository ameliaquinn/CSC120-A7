Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
Cafe class: I overloaded the constructor to create a default constructor as well as a constructor with the only known parameter being the amount of coffee. This subclass in particular has a lot of parameters in its constructor, and it's likely that you might not know how much sugar / cream / coffee / cups / everything you have when creating your cafe. 

House class: I overloaded the moveIn() and moveOut() methods to take in 2 input parameters, that way you can move out two people at once. I did this because often people are moving in / out of houses in large groups or in partners if they are roommates, and it might be easier to keep track of the code if you could do that in one method. 

Library class: I overrode the constructors to create different options depending if there was a given name and address or not, just to allow for ease of creating the library. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think I understand overloading methods -- I'm still a little confused on overriding and the terminology, so I'd give the advice of taking your time, and making sure you understand what the assignment is before jumping right into code.
